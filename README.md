# Decentralized Exchange

![project image](https://github.com/dinesh-jaysiri/react-dexchange/blob/main/project_image.png?raw=true)

#### Purpose
A decentralized exchange (DEX) built using order book technique, aimed at providing a secure and transparent platform for users to swap their digital assets. The DEX eliminates the need for intermediaries, ensuring that users have full control over their funds at all times.

#### Key Features

Order book technique for efficient matching of orders
Transparent transactions with no intermediaries
Secure platform with user control over funds
Integration with popular wallet provider, MetaMask, for seamless interaction with the platform

#### Technologies Used

React and Redux for building the front-end interface
Redux Toolkit for state management
Solidity for writing smart contracts
Chai for testing the contracts with Hardhat
Ether.js for interacting with the contracts from the front-end

#### Results
The decentralized exchange provides users with a secure and transparent platform for trading their digital assets, eliminating the need for intermediaries and giving users full control over their funds. The use of order book technique ensures efficient matching of orders and the integration with MetaMask provides a seamless user experience.

#### Challenges & Solutions
One of the biggest challenges in building a 
DEX is ensuring that transactions are secure and transparent. 
This was achieved by utilizing solidity contracts and thoroughly testing them using Chai and Hardhat. 
Another challenge was building a user-friendly interface that could interact with the contracts seamlessly. 
This was achieved by using React and Redux, and integrating with MetaMask for a seamless user experience.


## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
